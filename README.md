# Song Recommendation System Using Data From Spotify
## Overview of the Project
As commonly defined, Recommender Systerm is a subclass of information filtering system that aims to predict the preference  of a specific user towards a particular service or item. This type of system are commonly used in commercial applications such as Netflix, E-commerce and many more. 
<br>
<br>Spotify, an audio streaming and media service provider, is a great example of a commercial application that uses a recommendation system. Despite its extremely complete system and algorithm, multiple userts still expresses their disbelief towards the song recommendations generated by Spotify. Thus, this project aims to formulate a Song Recommendation System using data from Spotify to predict a list of recommended songs based on a user's preference.
